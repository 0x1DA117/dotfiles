# iTerm2

This directory contains my configuration for the [iTerm2][iterm2] terminal
emulator. It os only used for backup purpose since iTerm2 saves this file
whenever I close iTerm2.

If you are interested in how to save and load the configuration, have a look at
the iTerm2 preferences under `General` and `Preferences`. There you have two
checkboxes that you can activate.
